# DeepGO: Reachability Analysis of Deep Neural Networks with Provable Guarantees

### Contain seven folders:

DNN-1 to DNN-7 contain the all the reachability analysis for 20 images and 4 features for 7 DNN models. 

The lipschitz constant is dynamically estimate during the searching.

DNN2_img_1_feaNew_3: indicates DNN-2, ImageIndex-1 (i.e., 1st image in MNIST testing dataset), and feature-3

### Each image has three sub-images:

left: input image

middle: image on lower boundary

right: image on the upper boundary

### Image Title: 

first number: logit value

second number: confidence
